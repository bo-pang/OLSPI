# OLSPI
This is the code for the simulation part of the paper 
> Pang, Bo, and Zhong-Ping Jiang. "Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Optimal Stationary Control of Linear Stochastic Systems." arXiv preprint [arXiv:2107.07788](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07788) (2021).
## data_generate_MIMO.m
This scripts generates input/state data from the continuous-time linear stochastic system to be controlled.
## RPI_unknownQR_learning_continuous.m
This scripts learn the near-optimal stationary control policy using the collected input/state data.
## draw_picture_batch.m
This scripts generates the Figure 1 in the paper.
## MIMO_simulation.m
This scripts generates the Figure 2 and Figure 3 in the paper.
## Environment
I successfully ran the code in MATLAB R2017b.
